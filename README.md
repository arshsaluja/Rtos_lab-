# Real Time Operating System Lab
This Repository contains all the programs done in lab written in C as well as C++

## 1. memoryMap.c

This program is all about printing the memory map of the system using C code
It can be divided into 5 parts:-
##### a)A global variable (declaration and initialization) and a static integer variable value (declaration and initialization) into main method
##### b)Contains only global variable (only declaration)
##### c)A global variable and a static integer variable (only declaration) into main method
##### d)A global variable (only declaration) and a static integer variable value (declaration and initialization) into main method
##### e)Initalized Global Variable stored in DS and initialized static variable stored in DS.

## 2. timeDelay.c

This program prints a random number after a certain amount of delay. The Value of the delay will be provided by the user. The Delay function gets an interrupt whenever any key press in there.

## Compile

```
 gcc memoryMap.c
 gcc timeDelay.c
 ./a.out
 ```
